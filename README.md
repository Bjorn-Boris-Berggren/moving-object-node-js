# moving-object-node-js
This task was given to me. It is a Node.js console app that simulates a moving object in a matrix. 

## The Task
The task is to accept a set of commands and then simulate whether an object can move according to these commands without falling off the table it stands on. The table can be seen as a matrix where the object will have an x and y position as drawn below. The object always occupies exactly one cell and can be seen as a point without mass. Origo is at the top left.

## Commands
The object always has a direction (north, east, south or west). A simulation always starts with direction north. North means that if the object sits on [2, 4] and moves forward one step, the object will now stand on [2, 3].

The commands are:<br />
0 = quit simulation and the print result to stout<br />
1 = move forward one step<br />
2 = move backwards one step<br />
3 = rotate clockwise 90 degrees (eg north to east)<br />
4 = rotate counterclockwise 90 degrees (eg west to south)<br />
<br />
Use comma as separator between commands. Inputs are "binary" integers, not letters. You should therefore not interpret the letter ZERO ("0") or the letter ONE (‚Äù1").

## Example
If the program gets 4,4,2,2 as input, the table is initiated to size 4 x 4 with the object in position [2, 2] with direction north. Then, commands 1,4,1,3,2,3,2,4,1,0 are read
from stdin and executed. The final output would then be the end position of the object, in this case [0, 1].


## Things to keep in mind
It is always possible to solve the task without any real structure, but the point here is to use a well known object oriented and/or functional architecture.
A good code structure should also allow for expanded functionality in the future. For example, would it be easy to:
- Handle a different shapes other than a rectangle - Add more commands
- Change the binary form of the protocol to JSON Timing
Estimated time to complete this task is around 8 hours.
